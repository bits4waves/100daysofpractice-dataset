This project investigates ways to measure the quality of a musical tone using basic structural components.

Helmholtz (1) proposed a basic sound taxonomy for the sound comprised by
- /intensity/,
- /pitch/, and
- /quality/.

This is depicted in the figure above.

The basic structural COMPONENTS chosen for this project were derived from this taxonomy:

- /resonance/, related to intensity;
- /intonation/, related to pitch;
- /harmonicity/, related to quality.

The COMPONENTS are filled with light grey in the picture above.

The action plan for this project has the following steps:

1. produce software capable of measuring the COMPONENTS given a musical tone;
2. obtain musical tone samples of different quality levels;
3. measure the COMPONENTS of step 2 using the software from step 1;
4. analyze the correlation between the COMPONENTS and the quality levels.

The strategies for each step are:

1. produce the software /in-house/ ([[http://bits4waves.wordpress.com/?p=582][Ling Ling Meter]]);
2. extract the sound from practice videos of musicians with different proficiency levels ([[https://github.com/bits4waves/100daysofpractice-dataset][#100daysofpractice-dataset]]).

Steps 3 and 4 are self-explanatory.

For more details about the inspiration for this project, please continue reading.

In his seminal book, /On the Sensations of Tone/ (1), Helmholtz proposed the characterization of a musical tone by
- intensity,
- pitch, and
- quality.
This is depicted in the figure above.

These three components may be relativelly well described in terms of their partials:
- the intensity of the sound being the sum of the individual intensities of the partials, and
- the pitch being a function of the frequency of the fundamental and corresponding upper partials,
- the quality encompassing other carachteristics besides intensity and pitch, e.g., deviations or conformities relative to expected individual characteristics of the partials.

Additionally,
- /resonance/ may increase the intensities of the partials, thus increasing the overall sound intensity
- /intonation/ determines the frequency of the fundamental, hence the pitch itself
- /harmonicity/ reflects how close the frequency of each upper partial is to the corresponding “ideal” one (the one that maximizes /consonance/).
