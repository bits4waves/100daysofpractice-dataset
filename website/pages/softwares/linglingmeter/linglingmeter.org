This program outputs the

- intonation,
- harmonicity, and
- resonance

in a sound sample (e.g., a musical tone).

This is done by following these steps:

1. estimate the fundamental of the sound sample, obtain its intensity, and difference from the expected corresponding frequency (A440 as reference);
2. calculate the expected ideal frequencies for the corresponding upper partials---integer multiples of the fundamental estimated in step (1);
3. analyze the power spectrum of the sound sample, and, for each ideal frequency calculated in (2), find the peak that is closest to that frequency;
4. for each peak found in (3), obtain its actual frequency, the difference between the actual and ideal frequencies, and corresponding intensity.

The program then outputs:

- intonation as a function of the difference found in step (1);
- harmonicity as a function of the differences found in step (4);
- resonance as a function of the intensities found in step (4).
