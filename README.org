Data from Instagram posts with the hashtag =#100daysofpractice=.

The file [[https://github.com/bits4waves/100daysofpractice-dataset/blob/master/data/posts/posts.zip?raw=true][posts.zip (40 MB)]] contains data from 450,000 Instagram posts with the hashtag =#100daysofpractice=.

=posts.zip= contains two files:
- =posts.csv=, which contains the posts data, and
- =metadata.txt=, which contains the details about its generation.

=posts.csv= is in the CSV format (everything quoted with @@html:<code>@@"@@html:</code>@@, separated by @@html:<code>@@,@@html:</code>@@).
The fields therein and a short explanation are:
- =post-id=: postâ€™s unique ID
- =shortcode=: a short string that can be used to access the post in a web browser (see below for instructions)
- =taken_at_timestamp=: the date when it was posted
- =owner-id=: a unique ID representing the user who posted it; this data was anonymized for privacy reasons, therefore this is not the real user ID
- =is_video=: =1= if it is a video, =0= otherwise
- =edge_liked_by-count=: number of likes
- =edge_media_to_comment-count=: number of comments
- =video_view_count=: number of views
- =comments_disabled=: =1= if comments were disabled, =0= otherwise
- =__typename=: =GraphImage= if it is an image post, =GraphVideo= for video one, or =GraphSidecar= for a post with more than one media
- =hashtags=: hashtags from the comments

To access the post in a web browser using a shortcode, just paste it after =https://www.instagram.com/p/=.
For instance the first post with the hashtag =#100daysofpractice= has the shortcode =BTrwiUuh8vV=.
Hence you may access it with the link https://www.instagram.com/p/BTrwiUuh8vV.
It was posted by the creator of the hashtag, =@violincase=, the violin virtuosa Hilary Hahn.
